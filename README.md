# mandel
This is a really simple C executable. It's only purpose is to dump a few iterations of the Mandelbrot set into your terminal in plain text.

You can specify the size and resolution (number of iterations) with a couple of command line options:
```
./mandel -l 33 -r 23
```
`-l`  Same as `--length=?` specifies the vertical length of the image

`-r`  Same as `--resolution=?` specifies the number of iterations
